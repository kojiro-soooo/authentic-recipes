# An e-commerce application for people that want a place for authentic recipes and groceries to live together.
As a migrant, I have a deep appreciation for authentic, home-made food and the way that it connects me with the places that I've called home, including Japan, India, Australia, and the USA. As of now, I haven't been able to find a modern and polished website where:
 1. A user can browse recipes from every country in the world
 2. A user can upload their own recipes
 3. A user can (similarly to websites like Reddit) vote for recipes that they agree are authentic
 4. A user can directly purchase hard-to-find groceries for recipes on the website

This website is the first iteration of building towards the website I described above, with the intent of first creating a modern front-end that accomplishes some of the goals listed above. The goal here is to add a passion project to my portfolio.
