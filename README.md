# An e-commerce application for people that want a place for authentic recipes and groceries to live together.

As a migrant, I have a deep appreciation for authentic, home-made food and the way that it connects me with the places that I've called home, including Japan, India, Australia, and the USA. As of now, I haven't been able to find a modern and polished website where:
 1. A user can browse recipes from every country in the world [In-progress]
 2. A user can upload their own recipes [In-progress]
 3. A user can (similarly to websites like Reddit) vote for recipes that they agree are authentic [Backlog]
 4. A user can directly purchase hard-to-find groceries for recipes on the website [Backlog]

This website a work-in-progress with the intent of accomplishing the goals listed above in increments.
