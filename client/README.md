### ChatGPT prompt used to generate recipes:

Give me 5 recipes formatted exactly like the following as json objects, with no commas in between opening and closing double quotations. Make the content of the description key written as if it's written by someone who is sharing a family or personal recipe. Recipes should be diverse, meaning that they come from a variety of countries, not just well-known countries or well-known recipes. Each recipe should also originate from a single country. For example, Chicken Tikka Masala is a recipe that is not known to originate from a single country, instead, it's said to have originated possibly from India, Pakistan, and Ireland. Only give me recipes that are known to be from a specific country. Separate each recipe object with a comma. Additionally, each attribute should be in quotations. For example, title should be "title", description should be "description", and so on. Finally, every recipe should be unique, which means you cannot give me two JSON objects with the same value for the title attribute.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
