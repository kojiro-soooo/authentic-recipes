            At Authentic Recipes, we understand the power of authentic,
            home-made food in connecting people with their cultural roots. As
            migrants ourselves, we have a deep appreciation for the flavors and
            traditions that remind us of the places we've called home: Japan,
            India, Australia, the USA, and beyond.
