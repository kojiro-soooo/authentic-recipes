Oyako Donburi

A classic Japanese comfort food that my mom always made!

Japan

2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts,
1 onion, thinly sliced,
4 large eggs,
2 tablespoons soy sauce,
2 tablespoons mirin (sweet rice wine),
1 tablespoon sugar,
1 cup dashi stock (or substitute with chicken or vegetable broth),
4 cups cooked Japanese short-grain rice,
2 green onions thinly sliced (optional, for garnish)

1. Slice the chicken breasts into thin strips or bite-sized pieces.
2. In a large skillet or frying pan, heat some oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and saut√© until they become translucent and slightly caramelized.
3. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until it is no longer pink and is lightly browned.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and dashi stock. Pour the mixture into the skillet with the chicken and onions. Bring it to a simmer.
5. Once the sauce is simmering, reduce the heat to low. In a small bowl, beat the eggs. Slowly pour the beaten eggs over the chicken and onion mixture. Try to distribute the eggs as evenly as possible.
6. Cover the skillet and let it cook on low heat for about 5 minutes, or until the eggs are set but still slightly runny.
7. Remove the skillet from heat. Serve the oyako donburi by spooning the chicken, eggs, and sauce over a bowl of steamed rice.
8. Garnish with sliced green onions, if desired.
9. Enjoy your homemade oyako donburi!
